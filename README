Just a collection of my personal dot files.  All are some manner of a work in progress and rough around the edges.
They tend to be updated as I have time and inclination.

Some are set to work with my Ubuntu setup and others with my Arch setup.



Various config files for programs
Xmonad - Tiling window manager - xmonad.hs
	xmonad.start is a little autostart script for various programs. It's not very good at the moment but it gets the job done. 
Xmobar - status bar designed to work with Xmonad - .xmobarrc

Awesome - Tiling window manager - rc.lua

Xdefaults - sets terminal properties among other things
