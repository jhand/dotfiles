Just a collection of my personal dot files.  All are some manner of a work in progress and rough around the edges.
They tend to be updated as I have time and inclination.

Some are set to work with Ubuntu defaults and other are Arch. 



Various config files for programs
Xmonad - Tiling window manager - xmonad.hs
Xmobar - status bar designed to work with Xmonad - .xmobarrc

Awesome - Tiling window manager - rc.lua
Bashrc - Configures bash -  ~

Xdefaults - sets terminal properties among other things
